    <h1>About Brent</h1>
  <aside id="box">
    <p> Iâ€™m a Web Developer with a background in fundraising that focuses on building apps and websites to make life better for others. </p>
    <p id="side"> I started dabbling with code a few years ago as hobby.  My previous career was in political and nonprofit fundraising, so coding was a refreshing change of pace.  I started using free websites like Code Academy and just tinkering with it on my own.  The thrill of getting my code to work and the excitement of building things started to grow.</p>
    <p id="side2">I took a couple Python classes at the UW Extension School, which I really enjoyed, but I decided to focus more on JavaScript.  In 2014, I successfully completed Code Fellows two-month intensive Full-Stack JavaScript Development Accelerator program and have been a Web Developer ever since.

    <h2> Family</h2>
    <p> I've been lucky enough to be married to my beautiful and wonderful wife, Rosia, for almost 4 years now (we started dating 8 years ago). We also have two quirky and adorable cats</p>

    <p>My wife is graduating this year from Bastyr University as a Naturopathic Doctor.  She is a blessing in my life, a healer, teacher and advocate for Naturopathic medicine.  If you'd like to find out more about how an ND can help you checkout:</p>

    <p> Here in the Pacific Northwest, we have a ton of great trails to choose from-- I love hiking off Highway 2, the Mountain Loop Highway, or if I have time, I enjoy hiking the North Cascades or even Mount Rainier.</p>

    <h2> Sports</h2>
    <p> As a native of the Washington DC area, I love all DC sports teams even though they continue to break my heart.</p>
    <p> The Wizards are going all the way this year!!!</p>

    <h2> Past Career</h2>

    <p> In a previous life I worked in politics.  I have been a Finance Director on a number of statewide and congressional campaigns all over the country.  Working in politics was great, but now I'm pursuing other endeavors, including coding-- maybe someday I'll find a way to merge my passion for both!</p>
    <img src='pics/1909633_10301700820_3602_n.jpg'>
    <p> I obviously still love politics, so now I use tools like Huffington Post API to stay connected-- here's something I created to see the most current presidential approval ratings!</p>
